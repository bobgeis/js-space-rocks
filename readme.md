# jsSpaceRocks

This is a learning project made while learning javascript.  It's an asteroids clone, because whenever one learns a new language, it's fun to make a game in it, and I happen to like asteroids.

[__Play it here.__](http://bobgeis.github.io/js-space-rocks/)


## Controls

Keyboard:
* LEFT (or A) and RIGHT (or D) rotate the player ship
* UP (or W) accelerates the player ship
* DOWN (or S) reverses
* SPACE fires the disintegrator
* P pauses, ENTER unpauses
* Z activates the Omega 13: "Enough time to undo a single mistake" Note that if charged, you can use this even if your ship is destroyed.
* ENTER starts the game, restarts on destruction (remember to try Z if you can)
* U resets the high score to all zeros


## Objectives

Oh No! Some hooligans are dumping space rocks in to Subspace Locus 1457 again!

Luckily, a dedicated rescue and rock-buster ship is already prepped and on-site.  That's you!

* Try to keep Subspace Locus 1457 safe for travelers.
* If any ships get hit by rocks, pick up their lifepods and deliver them to the medbay in the North East quadrant for treatment.
* If you pick up any crystalline minerals from busting rocks, deliver those to the prospector base in the South West quadrant for analysis.
* If you get into a jam, hopefully you have enough charge on your Omega-13 to try again.  Good luck!
